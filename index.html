RECENT PERFORMANCE:
" + historyText + "

Josh is 56, trains twice weekly with HIT/TUT methodology.

Based on his recent pattern, give tactical guidance drawing from exercise science or HIT principles. Examples:
- 'Your CNS will be freshest on exercise 1 - that's where real strength gains happen'
- 'McGuff emphasizes infrequent loading for recovery - you're hitting optimal frequency'
- 'Fatigue is cumulative across the session - prioritize quality reps early, survive the finish'

1-2 sentences. Draw from Arthur Jones, Doug McGuff, or practical recovery science. Never cite specific weights or TUT numbers - focus on approach and principles.";

POST-WORKOUT PROMPT (around line 336-352):
Replace with:
            var prompt = "You're Josh's HIT coach reviewing Workout " + currentWorkout + ".

TODAY:

CONTEXT (last 8 weeks):
" + historyText + "

Josh is 56, trains for longevity with HIT/TUT methodology.

Explain WHY today went this way using exercise science, then prescribe an adjustment. Examples:
- 'Set 1 intensity created excessive metabolic debt - next time, Jones's principle: don't go to failure on first set'
- 'Posterior chain fatigue suggests systemic recovery issue - Darden recommends extra day between sessions'
- 'Consistent strength across movements indicates proper stress-recovery balance - this is the sweet spot'

3-4 sentences. Reference HIT principles (Jones, Darden, McGuff) or recovery science when explaining patterns. Never cite specific weights or TUT numbers - interpret the data through training principles.";
